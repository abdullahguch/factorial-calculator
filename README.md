## Introduction

This Python script provides a function to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer. Factorial is defined as the product of all positive integers from 1 to the given integer.

Example:
- Factorial of 5 (written as 5!) is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.

## Usage

To use the factorial calculator, simply call the `factorial` function with a non-negative integer as an argument. Here's an example of how to use it in your Python code:

```python
from factorial_calculator import factorial

num = 5
result = factorial(num)
print(f"The factorial of {num} is {result}")

```
